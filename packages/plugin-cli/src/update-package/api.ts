/**
 * Programmatic package-update API.
 *
 * Reads the publisher's existing `com.emdashcms.experimental.package.profile`
 * record (the per-package metadata record in the registry lexicon — distinct
 * from the publisher's atproto profile at `app.bsky.actor.profile`), diffs
 * the lexicon-controlled fields against a manifest-derived candidate, and
 * (when applied) writes the new record via `com.atproto.repo.putRecord`.
 *
 * Splits cleanly from the CLI command so tests can run it against a mock
 * `PublishingClient` without going through OAuth or the filesystem.
 *
 * Scope
 * -----
 *
 * Only fields the manifest controls are eligible for update: `license`,
 * `authors`, `security`, `name`, `description`, `keywords`, `sections`.
 * Required fields are diffed and written; optional fields (`name`,
 * `description`, `keywords`, `sections`) follow a "manifest absent = no
 * change" policy so removing a manifest key doesn't silently wipe a
 * published value. Identity fields (`$type`, `id`, `slug`, `type`) are
 * preserved verbatim. `lastUpdated` is auto-set to now whenever there are
 * changes to apply. Unknown fields from a future lexicon revision pass
 * through unchanged
 * so a CLI from an older revision doesn't silently drop forward-compatible
 * data on a write-back.
 *
 * Concurrency: the read-then-write uses atproto's `swapRecord` CID-based
 * CAS precondition. Concurrent writes between read and write surface as
 * `STALE_RECORD` rather than silently overwriting the other writer.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *
 *   - `PACKAGE_NOT_FOUND`: no package record exists at the manifest's slug
 *     and the publisher has no other packages either. The user must run
 *     `publish` first to bootstrap.
 *   - `POSSIBLE_RENAME`: no record at the manifest's slug, but the publisher
 *     already has one or more packages at other slugs. Refused so a manifest
 *     rename doesn't orphan releases under the old slug.
 *   - `PACKAGE_INVALID`: the existing record doesn't validate against the
 *     package profile lexicon. We refuse to write rather than overwrite an
 *     unknown shape with our canonical one.
 *   - `SLUG_MISMATCH`: defensive guard against the existing record's `slug`
 *     field differing from the manifest's slug. Aggregators reject records
 *     where slug doesn't match the rkey, but if a publisher hand-edited the
 *     record we want a clear refusal before we make it worse.
 *   - `INVALID_INPUT`: caller input fails the structural checks
 *     `validateInput` enforces (empty arrays, missing contact details).
 *   - `STALE_RECORD`: the record was modified between our read and write.
 *     The caller should re-run to recompute the diff against latest state.
 *   - `LEXICON_VALIDATION_FAILED`: the merged candidate failed the lexicon
 *     check (usually because the caller exceeded a length/grapheme cap not
 *     covered by `validateInput`).
