/**
 * Verify that the active session matches the manifest's pinned `publisher`,
 * and write the publisher back to the manifest on first publish.
 *
 * Two paths, depending on the manifest state at publish time:
 *
 *   1. Manifest pins a publisher (DID or handle).
 *      - DID: compare verbatim against the session DID. Mismatch is an
 *        immediate, no-override error. The user must `emdash-plugin switch`
 *        to the right session, or edit the manifest if they're transferring
 *        the plugin.
 *      - Handle: resolve to a DID via `@atcute/identity-resolver`, then
 *        compare. Resolution failures surface as a distinct error code so
 *        the user can tell "wrong handle" from "wrong account".
 *   2. Manifest omits `publisher`.
 *      - Publish proceeds with the active session.
 *      - On success, the CLI writes `"publisher": "<session-did>"` back
 *        to the manifest file using `jsonc-parser`'s `modify` + `applyEdits`
 *        so comments and formatting are preserved.
 *
 * The write-back is a post-publish convenience: failures here MUST NOT
 * roll back or fail the publish. The publish has already committed to the
 * publisher's PDS by this point.
 *
 * The DID-only write-back rule (we never write a handle) is documented
 * in #1028. Hand-written handles are respected verbatim; the user can
 * still pin a handle if they prefer the readability.

 *
 * If the `publisher` property can't be located (unexpected — we just
 * inserted it), returns the input unchanged. Annotation is a nice-to-
 * have; the publish has already succeeded.
 *
 * No sanitisation of the handle is needed: `session.handle` is
 * populated by atproto's identity resolver at login time, which only
 * accepts values that (a) match the handle syntax (no control chars,
 * no `/`, no `*`, no whitespace) and (b) round-trip via DoH or
