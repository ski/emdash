/**
 * @emdash-cms/plugin-types
 *
 * Shared TypeScript types for the EmDash plugin manifest contract.
 *
 * Two packages need to agree on this shape:
 *
 *   - **`emdash` (core)** reads `manifest.json` at install time and again at
 *     runtime when gating a sandboxed plugin's access to capabilities. Core
 *     is the contract reader.
 *   - **`@emdash-cms/plugin-cli`** writes `manifest.json` during bundling
 *     (extracted from the plugin author's source) and publishes the resulting
 *     records via atproto. plugin-cli is the contract writer.
 *
 * Anything that has to round-trip cleanly between writer and reader belongs
 * here: the capability vocabulary, the manifest shape, the hook/route entry
 * types, and the legacy-name rename map.
 *
 * Things that don't belong here:
 *
 *   - `ResolvedPlugin` and the rest of core's runtime plugin types — those
 *     are core-internal shapes for in-memory plugin instances and pull in
 *     a lot of Astro / blocks / schema dependencies.
 *   - The `@atcute/*` lexicon types for the registry's atproto records.
 *     Those live in `@emdash-cms/registry-lexicons` since they describe a
 *     different contract layer.
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL: this package is published as part of the experimental plugin
 * registry roll-out. Pin to an exact version while RFC 0001 is in flight;
 * the manifest shape may evolve before the registry phase 1 cutover.
