/**
 * @emdash-cms/registry-client
 *
 * Atproto-aware client for the EmDash plugin registry. Three layers:
 *
 *   - **Credentials** (`./credentials`): persisting the publisher's atproto
 *     session between CLI invocations. Three implementations: filesystem,
 *     env-vars (CI), in-memory (tests).
 *   - **Publishing** (`./publishing`): repo operations against the publisher's
 *     own PDS using a session built by `@atcute/oauth-node-client`. Used by
 *     the CLI's `emdash-plugin publish` flow.
 *   - **Discovery** (`./discovery`): read-only XRPC client over an aggregator.
 *     No authentication. Used by both the CLI (`emdash-plugin search` /
 *     `emdash-plugin info`) and the EmDash admin UI's install flow.
 *
 * The two halves are deliberately decoupled so consumers that only need
 * discovery (most notably the admin UI) don't have to pull in the publishing
 * surface or its OAuth dependencies.
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL: this client targets the experimental aggregator and
 * `com.emdashcms.experimental.*` lexicons. NSIDs and shapes will change while
 * RFC 0001 is in flight; pin to an exact version.

// throw `ClientResponseError` on non-2xx responses; it carries `.error`,
